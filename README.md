In this project offered data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

Complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:


Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)


In addition, produced the following three pie charts:


% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type



Used Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
Used the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
Included a written description of observable trends based on the data.
Have labeled plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.


Pyber color scheme (Gold, Light Sky Blue, and Light Coral) in producing your plot and pie charts.
